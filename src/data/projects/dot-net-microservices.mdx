## **Overview**
This repository is meant to explain with simple samples how to design and develop microservices using .NET and C#. This hands-on guide will take you on a journey through the world of microservices architecture and help you craft scalable, maintainable, and fault-tolerant applications.

# Summary
This repository pretends to be a base for a small course about how to build microservices with .Net and C#. In the repository there are several .Net projects simulating 2 microservices of a fictinional Bank System.

The first microservices is the Account Management, and the second one is the Notification service of the Bank system. As you can see in the following image even both microservices are built with .Net, the Account Management Service uses MongoDB as Database and the API's are built with the Controller approach. The Notification service was built using the minimal API approach and PostgreSQL as the database. The entire repository is based on the Julio Casal course that can be found at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByYyk8eMG6c).
